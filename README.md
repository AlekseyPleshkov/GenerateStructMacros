# GenerateStructMacro

Swift macros to generate a struct based on a class. When you add the @GenerateStruct annotation to the class, it will generate the struct inside the class with the same properties and access levels.

```swift
@GenerateStruct
public class Test {
    private let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    // The following code is generated by macros
    
    public func toStruct() -> StructTest {
        StructTest(name: self.name, age: self.age)
    }

    public struct StructTest {
        private let name: String
        internal let age: Int

        public init(name: String, age: Int) {
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
        }
    }
}
```
